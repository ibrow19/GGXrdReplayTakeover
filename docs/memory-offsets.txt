Save State WTY notes:
save is at RVA ffba50, load is at RVA ffb9f0, they are thiscall functions for an object at RVA 1ad7100, and iirc (it's been a while, I'm going to get back to this eventually to sort out the issues but I have a lot to pop off my todo stack) you really don't want to be calling them directly but load takes an int argument for the slot
[18:20]
(My WIP code was not calling them directly, it was using a function table that's part of the class.  Not a vtable, a structure with non-member function pointers)
[18:21]
Er to be clear not part of the class of the object at 1ad7100, that object has a pointer as the first member to the object with the class I'm talking about
